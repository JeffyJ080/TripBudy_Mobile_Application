# Project Overview

## Initial View
TripBuddy is a project that I was tasked with during my mobile development course. We were tasked with the creation of a trip documentation and budgeting system that is different from what is currently on the market. 
The idea is to create an app where the documentation and budgeting is merged and stored as one while the users also have a form of personalisation by being able to upload their photos with text and emojis during and after their trip. This will be visible to them on a timeline that they can view. This is an interesting project and I am glad for being able to embark on it since there is much that I can learn from it rather than just completing it for marks.
This will be my first project using java and I am hoping that it is not as horrible as people say it is. I will also be learning the basics of UI design for mobile users during this project but I myself will try and take it as far as possible so I can one day do it if it is asked of me. I'll be learning how to incorporate SQL into mobile development and also store any and all data that the user saves on the app including Images, Animations, Music, and Text. 
This is the man things that I am hoping to learn from the project, the biggest two being Mobile development and the second being Java. 

Listed below are the things that we were tasked to complete during the course of the project:

- [x] Designing and implementing model classes (User, Trip, Memory, etc.)

- [x] Building Activities for trip planning, budgeting, and memory posting

- [x] Handling dynamic content (images, music, animations)

- [x] Applying multimedia tools (e.g., MediaPlayer, RecyclerView)

- [x] Managing persistent data using SQLite or SharedPreferences (Used both)

- [x] Creating intuitive, branded user interfaces and interaction flows

- [x] Applying discount logic and tracking usage for loyalty purposes

- [x] Providing real-time budget feedback and summary reports

- [x] Handling edge cases such as invalid input or missing data
 
## During Development
I have lost a lot of sleep. In two weeks I actually completed this app and it looks good if I say so myself. 
There was a lot of tasks given to us to complete but the further I got the more work it became with very little marks awarded to the result. They wanted use to make editable posts for 2 marks, crazy stuff. In the end I decided to skip out on around 10 marks of content but the entire app still functions and looks sleek.

Learning throughout this project has been interesting. Most of my learning content came straight from the documentation so I am greatful that it was somewhere even though the sources aren't great or ideal. 
The java still has me going downhill, I keep thinking it will get better but it doesn't. Like someone said recently to me, "C# is Java done right.". Boy can I agree more?
The java was good and relatively okay to do since it is similar to C# but damn is it tedious, 3 lines in C# is like 15 lines in java. New respect to people choosing this language.

## After Completion
This has been the longest two weeks of my life. 
Learning UI, Android Studio as a IDE and as a documentation source, java coding and working with new features I didn't know existed. This definitely ended up being worth the lack of sleep and the overdose with caffiene. 

I really enjoyed making this project and if it was not for the fact that this is an assignment I would probably have done a few things different and tried working a bit nicer and like an actual app.
See you in the next one :)
