# Project Overview

## Initial View
TripBuddy is a project that I was tasked with during my mobile development course. We were tasked with the creation of a trip documentation and budgeting system that is different from what is currently on the market. 
The idea is to create an app where the documentation and budgeting is merged and stored as one while the users also have a form of personalisation by being able to upload their photos with text and emojis during and after their trip. This will be visible to them on a timeline that they can view. This is an interesting project and I am glad for being able to embark on it since there is much that I can learn from it rather than just completing it for marks.
This will be my first project using java and I am hoping that it is not as horrible as people say it is. I will also be learning the basics of UI design for mobile users during this project but I myself will try and take it as far as possible so I can one day do it if it is asked of me. I'll be learning how to incorporate SQL into mobile development and also store any and all data that the user saves on the app including Images, Animations, Music, and Text. 
This is the man things that I am hoping to learn from the project, the biggest two being Mobile development and the second being Java. 

Listed below are the things that we were tasked to complete during the course of the project:

- [x] Designing and implementing model classes (User, Trip, Memory, etc.)

- [ ] Building Activities for trip planning, budgeting, and memory posting

- [ ] Handling dynamic content (images, music, animations)

- [ ] Applying multimedia tools (e.g., MediaPlayer, RecyclerView)

- [ ] Managing persistent data using SQLite or SharedPreferences

- [ ] Creating intuitive, branded user interfaces and interaction flows

- [ ] Applying discount logic and tracking usage for loyalty purposes

- [ ] Providing real-time budget feedback and summary reports

- [ ] Handling edge cases such as invalid input or missing data
